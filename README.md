<h1>Sping 2019 ASCEND</h1>
Git Set-Up:
1. To clone the remote repo to your local machine, install Git @ https://git-scm.com/downloads. You should
have Git Bash, Git CMD, and Git GUI. We will use Git Bash.
2. In Git Bash, change the directory to the local folder you want the 'sp19ascend' folder to be
in. TIP: don't make a sp19ascend folder and clone there, you will nest folders
7. Type the command 'git clone [project url]' and cd into that folder
    *If you are rejected, you might not have the rights to this repo- talk to Cathy so she can add you!
8. To go from Git Bash to VSCode, you type 'code .' and the IDE will open with the dev folder.

Uploading to the Boi:
9. Once connected to the board, check your device manager that the Feather is recognized on your computer
and check the devices in the Arduino IDE. Upload when you want to test.

Coding Etiquette

Do's:
    - Comment before blocks of code briefly explaining what the purpose of the code is and
    include comments at least before each function
    - Create a branch each time you want to make a change or work - this way master stays clean
    - Ask for help if you need it and add resources you think are useful below

Don't:
    - Comment out blocks of code without briefly explaining why it isn't used (ex. '//Sensor not on board yet',
    '//Needs more information to finish')
    - Delete other's code without telling them/changing code without a detailed commit message
